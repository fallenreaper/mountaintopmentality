## Setting Up the Bot.
This requires both a Discord Access Token, AND node installed on your server.  After pulling the repository, you will simply call:

```
npm install
npm start
```

And it is as simple as that.  For Discord Access Token, while you can set it in the config.js file, you _can also_ set it in your local systems Environment Variables..

```
# Example
export DISCORD_TOKEN="sdfghjksdfghjdfguysdfgkuasdgkuag"
```

Alternatively we will have a docker container for this.  While can be built, but will soon exist on the Docker hub.
